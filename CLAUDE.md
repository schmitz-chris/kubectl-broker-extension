The tool is used as a kubectl plugin with subcommand architecture:

```bash
# Show available commands
kubectl broker

# Health diagnostics (consistent across broker and pulse)
kubectl broker status                                    # Simple usage with intelligent defaults
kubectl broker status --discover                         # Discovery mode
kubectl broker status --statefulset broker --namespace production
kubectl broker status --pod broker-0 --namespace production

# HiveMQ Pulse server diagnostics (consistent validation patterns)
kubectl broker pulse status                              # Simple usage with intelligent defaults
kubectl broker pulse status --discover                   # Discovery mode for Pulse servers
kubectl broker pulse status --namespace pulse --endpoint readiness

# Enhanced health API analysis with color-coded status indicators
kubectl broker status --json                             # Raw JSON output for external tools (colors disabled)
kubectl broker status --detailed                         # Detailed component breakdown + debug info (colors enabled)
kubectl broker status --endpoint liveness                # Specific health endpoint with colored status
kubectl broker status --statefulset broker --raw         # Unprocessed response (colors disabled)
kubectl broker status --pod broker-0 --endpoint readiness # Readiness check with colored indicators

# Backup management (standardized error handling and consistent UX)
kubectl broker backup create --statefulset broker --namespace production  # Create new backup
kubectl broker backup list --statefulset broker --namespace production     # List all backups
kubectl broker backup download --id abc123 --output-dir ./backups          # Download specific backup
kubectl broker backup download --latest --output-dir ./backups             # Download latest backup
kubectl broker backup status --id abc123                                   # Check backup status
kubectl broker backup status --latest                                      # Check latest backup status

# Volume management (consistent namespace handling and error messages)
kubectl broker volumes list                                                # List volumes in current namespace
kubectl broker volumes list --all-namespaces --detailed                    # Cluster-wide with usage data
kubectl broker volumes cleanup --dry-run                                   # Preview cleanup operations
kubectl broker volumes cleanup --confirm --older-than 30d                  # Clean old volumes

# Backup directory moving (Phase 8 enhancement) - moves within pod filesystem
kubectl broker backup create --destination /opt/hivemq/data/backup         # Move to data directory
kubectl broker backup create --destination /tmp --namespace production     # Move to tmp directory

# With authentication (optional)
kubectl broker backup create --username admin --password secret
```

## Architecture

- Cross-platform build system with size optimization

### âœ… Phase 5: Enhanced HiveMQ Health API Analysis (Completed)

- Advanced JSON parsing of HiveMQ health responses with Go structs
- Multiple output formats: tabular, JSON, raw, detailed component breakdown
- Support for different health endpoints: health, liveness, readiness
- Rich diagnostic information showing component-level health status
- External tool integration with JSON output for monitoring pipelines
- Clean minimal output by default, verbose debug info only with `--detailed` flag
- **Color-coded health status indicators** for improved visual recognition of broker states

### âœ… Phase 6: Subcommand Architecture (Completed)

- Extensible CLI structure with parent command and subcommands
- `status` subcommand containing all health checking functionality
- `pulse` subcommand for HiveMQ Pulse server diagnostics with consistent validation patterns
- `backup` subcommand with complete backup management operations
- `volumes` subcommand for volume management and cleanup operations
- Professional command structure following kubectl plugin patterns
- Maintains backward compatibility through clear command separation
- Product mode detection for dual broker/pulse operation modes

### âœ… Phase 7: HiveMQ Backup Management (Completed)

- Complete backup management system using HiveMQ REST API
- Four backup subcommands: create, list, download, status
- Intelligent defaults and consistent UX with existing health monitoring
- Progress indicators and status polling for long-running operations
    - File download with progress bars and automatic filename handling
- Color-coded status display matching health command patterns
- Comprehensive error handling with actionable guidance
- Authentication support for secured HiveMQ instances

### âœ… Phase 8: Backup Directory Move Enhancement (Completed)

- Automatic backup directory moving within pod filesystem using `--destination` flag
- Environment variable detection for backup folder location (`HIVEMQ_BACKUP_FOLDER`)
- Intelligent pod discovery to locate backup directories across StatefulSet instances
- Safety validations including destination path checks and overwrite protection on pods
- kubectl exec integration for secure move operations within pods
- Seamless integration with existing backup create workflow
- Move operation preserves directory structure and removes original location

### ðŸš€ Binary Size Optimization (Completed)

- Optimized from 53MB to 35MB (-34% reduction) using selective Kubernetes client imports
- Replaced full `kubernetes.Clientset` with specific typed clients (`CoreV1Client`, `AppsV1Client`)
- Advanced build optimization with `-ldflags="-w -s"`, `-trimpath`, `CGO_ENABLED=0`
- UPX compression support for Linux systems

## Key Technical Decisions

- **Optimized Kubernetes Integration**: Uses specific typed clients (`CoreV1Client`, `AppsV1Client`) instead of full
  `kubernetes.Clientset` for minimal binary size
- **Programmatic Port-Forwarding**: Self-contained operation using custom REST client for SPDY connections
- **Concurrent Architecture**: Goroutines with dynamic port allocation using centralized `GetRandomPort()` utility
- **Intelligent Defaults**: Context-aware namespace detection and StatefulSet name defaulting
- **User-Centric Installation**: `~/.kubectl-broker/` directory avoiding system-wide installation
- **HiveMQ-Specific**: Targets broker StatefulSets with health endpoints on port named "health"
- **Local Operator Focus**: Designed for diagnostic execution from operator machines
- **Enhanced Health Analysis**: Comprehensive JSON parsing with multiple output formats for both human operators and
  external tool integration
- **Color-Coded Status Display**: Visual health status indicators using `github.com/fatih/color` for improved user
  experience
- **Production Code Quality**: Clean, linter-compliant Go code following best practices with proper error handling and
  deprecation management

## HiveMQ Integration

The tool is specifically designed for HiveMQ broker clusters where:

- Brokers run as StatefulSets in Kubernetes
- Each pod exposes a health API endpoint (typically on port 9090)
- Health checks return JSON status information about cluster state, extensions, and MQTT listeners
- Multiple broker instances need to be checked individually to get complete cluster health status

### Enhanced Health API Support (Phase 5)

The tool now provides comprehensive analysis of HiveMQ's health API responses:

- **Component Analysis**: Parses and displays status of individual components (cluster, MQTT, extensions,
  control-center, rest-api, etc.)
- **Multiple Endpoints**: Supports `/api/v1/health/` (full), `/api/v1/health/liveness` (basic),
  `/api/v1/health/readiness` (ready to serve)
- **Status Interpretation**: Understands HiveMQ status values (UP, DOWN, DEGRADED, UNKNOWN, OUT_OF_SERVICE)
- **Output Formats**:
    - **Tabular**: Enhanced with component counts (e.g., "Overall: [UP], Components: 8 total, 8 healthy")
    - **JSON**: Raw responses for external tool integration (jq, monitoring systems)
    - **Detailed**: Component-by-component breakdown with details
    - **Raw**: Unprocessed responses for debugging

Example clean output (normal usage with color-coded status):

```
POD NAME  STATUS   DETAILS
--------  ------   -------
broker-0  HEALTHY  Overall: [UP], Components: 8 total, 8 healthy    # [UP] shown in green
broker-1  HEALTHY  Overall: [UP], Components: 8 total, 8 healthy    # [UP] shown in green

Summary: 2/2 pods healthy
```

**Color Scheme:**

- `[UP]`: Green + Bold (healthy status)
- `[DOWN]`: Red + Bold (critical/failed status)
- `[DEGRADED]`: Yellow + Bold (warning/degraded status)
- `[UNKNOWN]`: White (unclear status)
- `[OUT_OF_SERVICE]`: Magenta (intentionally offline)

Example detailed output (with `--detailed` flag):

```
Using default kubeconfig: /Users/chris/.kube/config
Using cluster: arn:aws:eks:eu-central-1:...
[... all debug information ...]

POD NAME  STATUS   HEALTH PORT  LOCAL PORT  RESPONSE TIME  DETAILS
--------  ------   -----------  ----------  -------------  -------
broker-0  HEALTHY  9090         54740       130ms          Overall: [UP], Components: 8 total, 8 healthy
broker-1  HEALTHY  9090         54741       113ms          Overall: [UP], Components: 8 total, 8 healthy

Summary: 2/2 pods healthy

Pod: broker-0
Overall Health: [UP]
Components:
  - cluster: [UP] (cluster-id: 2FVes, cluster-nodes: [dZIGZ fuD1n], ...)
  - extensions: [UP]
  [... detailed component breakdown ...]
```

```

## Command Consistency Standards

All commands now follow the same patterns established by `broker status`:

### Error Message Format
- Use `failed to determine default namespace` (not "get current namespace")
- Include helpful user guidance with "Please either:" format
- Provide actionable suggestions with specific flag examples
- Maintain consistent error structure across all subcommands

### Validation Patterns
- PreRunE for health commands (status, pulse status)
- Manual validation functions for management commands (backup, volumes)
- Consistent flag conflict checking (--json vs --raw)
- Unified namespace and resource defaulting logic

### User Experience
- All commands use same namespace detection and error messages
- Consistent debug output formatting and conditional display
- Unified approach to intelligent defaults with visual feedback
- Standardized help text and usage examples
